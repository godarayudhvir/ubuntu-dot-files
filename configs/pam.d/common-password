# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# Explanation of pam_unix options:
# The "yescrypt" option enables
#hashed passwords using the yescrypt algorithm, introduced in Debian
#11.  Without this option, the default is Unix crypt.  Prior releases
#used the option "sha512"; if a shadow password hash will be shared
#between Debian 11 and older releases replace "yescrypt" with "sha512"
#for compatibility .  The "obscure" option replaces the old
#`OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB' option in login.defs.  See the pam_unix manpage
#for other options.

# As of pam 1.0.1-6, this file is managed by pam-auth-update by default.
# To take advantage of this, it is recommended that you configure any
# local modules either before or after the default block, and use
# pam-auth-update to manage selection of other modules.  See
# pam-auth-update(8) for details.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)

# This line configures password quality requirements for PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).
# - 'requisite': If this module fails, authentication immediately fails.
# - 'pam_pwquality.so': Enforces strong password policies.
# - 'retry=5': Allows up to 5 attempts to enter a valid password.
# - 'minlen=8': Minimum password length is 8 characters.
# - 'difok=3': At least 3 characters must be different from the old password.
# - 'dcredit=-1': Requires at least 1 digit.
# - 'ucredit=-1': Requires at least 1 uppercase letter.
# - 'ocredit=-1': Requires at least 1 other (non-alphanumeric) character.
# - 'lcredit=-1': Requires at least 1 lowercase letter.
# - 'reject_username': Disallows passwords containing the username.
# - 'enforce_for_root': Enforces these rules for the root user as well.
# - 'gecoscheck=1': Checks password similarity against user information (GECOS field).
# - 'maxsequence=3': Disallows sequences of more than 3 consecutive characters.
# - 'maxclassrepeat=3': Disallows repeating the same character class more than 3 times.
